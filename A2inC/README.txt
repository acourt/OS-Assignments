All of the requirements have been completed. The elevator function as a real elevator, so it has to get to the persons to pick them up, and so on. I took the liberty of printing the ticks, so that you can know what is going on.

To compile the program run the command:
gcc -g -pthread main.c Person.c Elevator.c -o Elevator

The usage of this program is:
Elevator <Number of people> <Number of floors> <Print Level> <Maximum Capacity>
