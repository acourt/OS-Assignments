All the parts have been implemented, I've tested with the main that the TA has sent. and it seems to work. I've tested with a different quantum (10ms) and it seems to work fine.

TO COMPILE AND RUN:

Run the makefile and do:
"make all"

To run you must do:
"./main.o"

The output is essentially what is supposed to be obtained by running the TA's code (run with 10 ms as the quantum):
thread 0        RUNNABLE        0
thread 1        RUNNABLE        0
thread 2        RUNNABLE        0
thread 3        RUNNABLE        0
thread 4        RUNNABLE        0
thread 5        RUNNABLE        0
thread 6        RUNNABLE        0
thread 7        RUNNABLE        0
thread 8        RUNNABLE        0
thread 9        RUNNABLE        0
thread 0        EXIT    10
thread 1        EXIT    10
thread 2        EXIT    40
thread 3        EXIT    60
thread 4        EXIT    60
thread 5        EXIT    60
thread 6        EXIT    60
thread 7        EXIT    60
thread 8        EXIT    60
thread 9        EXIT    60
The counter is 50
The result is 151402.656521
